George Michael,I Want Your Sex,1,happy,"There's things that you guess
And things that you know
There's boys that you can trust
And girls that you don't
There's little things you hide
And little things that you show
Sometimes you think you're gonna get it
But you don't and that's just the way it goes

I swear I won't tease you won't tell you no lies

Yeah
I don't need no bible just look in my eyes

I've waited so long baby now that we're friends

Every man's got his patience and here's where mine ends

I want your sex
I want your love
I want your sex
I want your sex

It's playing on my mind
It's dancing on my soul
It's taken so much time
So why don't you just let me go?
I'd really like to try
Oh, I'd really love to know
When you tell me you're gonna regret it
Then I tell you that I love you but you still say NO!

I swear I won't tease you won't tell you no lies

Yeah
I don't need no bible just look in my eyes

Oooo
I've waited so long baby out in the cold

I can't take much more girl I'm loosing control

I want your sex
I want your love

Baby was her name
He knew she was crazy
Tiny was the same
Down behind the shed
Slaughtering the hog
Slice it on the belly
Feed it to the dog

Every motherfucker running up the hill
One, two, three, what should I do?
Get fucked up and fuck up you

Pussy liquor

Make ya sicker

Pussy liquor

Do it quicker

Yeah, I like to get fucked up, fucked up
Yeah, I like to get fucked up too

Bing Crosby,Swinging On A Star,1,happy,"Would you like to swing on a star
Carry moonbeams home in a jar
And be better off than you are
Or would you rather be a mule?

A mule is an animal with long funny ears
Kicks up at anything he hears
His back is brawny, but his brain is weak
He's just plain stupid with a stubborn streak

And by the way, if you hate to go to school
You may grow up to be a mule

Or would you like to swing on a star
Carry moonbeams home in a jar

Just bought a plane so we changin' the weather now
So put your brakes on, caps put your capes on
Or knock off your block, get dropped and have your face flown

Walked many roads

And found the great gates of fire

Had many storms

Gave armies reason to rise

The blood-stained walls, the lines of chalk on the floor

I can't remember
The way it was when everything felt right
My mouth held shut and eyes sealed tight with control

So I remember on the inside

I found a dark, infernal place, I don't wanna face anymore
Somehow I won't stop feeding the pain
My heart's just the same as before
I found a dark, infernal place, I dont wanna face anymore,
and somehow

So now I'm stuck here
Between the guilty and the insincere
The words I've spoke have left me here all alone
I should have known this

I wish it all gone
I could've burned it when I had that choice

No more ashes, no more sackcloth
And an armband made of black cloth
Will some day never more adorn a sleeve

For if the bomb that drops on you
Gets your friends and neighbors too
There'll be nobody left behind to grieve

And we will all go together when we go
What a comforting fact that is to know
Universal bereavement
An inspiring achievement
Yes, we all will go together when we go

Been here all along, so why can't you see?

Throws yesterday's headlines around
Another night comes and goes
So for awhile back then
There was someplace to go
Somewhere more home than a house
A family of choice not an accident
But sometimes as soon as something
Gets started it's over
Now the days are much shorter
And the people from the good part of town
All come around, but the something is missing
Even though there's more there now
I shrug off my attempts to explain
How a torn T-shirt made it all danger again
I don't like flashbacks in movies
I like the story to proceed
I don't like talking about the old days
Except if it tells where the future will lead
So we take a walk down this haunted hall
Or stumble through a shattered recall
I know there's nothing to relive

Even with our fists held high, yeah
It never would've worked out right, yeah
We were never meant for do or die

I didn't want us to burn out
I didn't come here to hurt you, now I can't stop

I want you to know
That it doesn't matter
Where we take this road
Someone's gotta go
And I want you to know
You couldn't have loved me better
But I want you to move on, so I'm already gone

Looking at you makes it harder
But I know that you'll find another
That doesn't always make you wanna cry
Started with a perfect kiss then
We could feel the poison set in

Kanye West,We Don't Care,1,happy,"Oh, yeah, I got the perfect song for the kids to sing

And all my people that's drug dealing just to get by
Stack your money 'til it gets sky high
We wasn't s'posed to make it past 25
Joke's on you we still alive
Throw your hands up in the sky and say
""We don't care what people say"" (yeah, yeah, yeah, uh)

If this is your first time hearin' this
You are about to experience somethin' so cold, man
We never had nothing handed, took nothing for granted
Took nothin' from no man, man, I'm my own man
But as a shorty I looked up to the dope man
Only adult man I knew that wasn't broke, man
Flickin' Starter coats man, man, you don't know, man
We don't care what people say

This is for my niggas outside all winter
'Cause this summer they ain't finna say, ""Next summer I'm finna...""
Sittin' in the hood like community colleges
This dope money here is Lil Tre's scholarship
'Cause ain't no tuition for havin' no ambition
And ain't no loans for sittin' yo' ass at home
So we forced to sell crack rap and get a job
You gotta do somethin', man, yo' ass is grown

Drug dealin' just to get by
Stack your money 'til it gets sky high
Kids sing, kids sing

Darren Hayes,A Conversation With God,3,sad,"We're driving
Just me and God
It's raining
It's raining hard
The windows
Are steaming up
The bridge
Engulfed by fog

The rest of
The metal bridge
It beckons
It pulls me in
I argue
I scream at God
For what he's offering

My hands fly off the steering wheel
Can't recall getting here
If I could, I would reach behind
And turn my light on
My thoughts run off the beaten track
There's no light
How's the way back
Take the hand of God
And bite the fear
No more lingering

Hell, there's plenty of light still left in your eyes

Breathing smoke through his microphone
The airwaves stretch and they groan
Bleeding, birthing his black diapason

Every color of sleeve to be rolled
Millions of rolling eyes that still cling to me

Between human beings and animals that you should know about

Sweat baby, sweat baby, sex is a Texas drought
Me and you do, the kind of stuff that only Prince would sing about
So put your hands down my pants and I'll bet you'll feel nuts
Yes I'm Siskel, yes I'm Ebert and you're getting two thumbs up

You've had enough of two-hand touch
You want it rough you're out of bounds

Just like the Coca-Cola stock you are inclined
To make me rise an hour early just like Daylight Savings Time

Always wrong with this or that
Poisoned with fear
Watch it twist my measly brain mad

Dark chill of this empty place

All my heart can hold

Wish I could take back such foolish pride
I felt you understood this love inside
Now it's just an arrow fallen wide
Of all my heart can hold

An old tar paper shack
On the south side of the town

Sometimes we did, but her hands flew from her side
Wild eyed crazy Mary

Down a long dirt road
Past the Parson's place
The old blue car
We used to race
Our little country store with a sign tacked to the side
Said, ""No L O I T E R I N G allowed""
Underneath that sign always congregated quite a crowd

I took the chances
Defended, battled and fought
Cause I really thought you loved me

I don't know where to start or where to stop, no
But I know I am done I've had enough

So fall out of my hands, out of my heart
And when you hit the ground
You'll be sorry that I'm not around
I will watch you while you
Fall out of your mind out of your fantasy
When you hit the wall think of me
I'll be on the top just watching you fall

What was wrong in the eyes of the cruel and unwise
They killed a man for his giro today

You'll be better off dead

How many years have we waited
For a ship that never set sail?
How many days have we wasted
Chasing a love that was not our own?

I sat ashore and watched as one
Hopeless wave crashed upon another
While my thoughts ran to the highest hills
My heart never, never reached the sea

With only delusions of an endless journey
I am left with an ocean between you and me
An ocean between

Is this your salvation?
Is this all you can give?
I will not stand in reflection
Of someone else's dream

An old acquaintance severed (burn the world, your last endeavor)

Flesh is burning, you can smell it in the air
'Cause men like you have such an easy soul to steal (steal)

You're now a slave until the end of time here

And it hurts to know that you belong here, yeah
Ooh, it's your f-in' nightmare

It's a mistake I sometimes make
My children lay asleep in bed
My wife lay wide-awake
I kissed her softly on the brow
I tried not to make a sound
But with stony eyes she looked at me
And gently squeezed my hand
Call it a premonition, call it a crazy vision
Call it intuition, something learned from mother
But when she looked up at me, I could clearly see
The Sword of Damocles hanging directly above her
Oh Lord Oh my Lord
Oh Lord
How have I offended thee?
Wrap your tender arms around me
Oh Lord Oh Lord
Oh My Lord

They were not making any sense
They claimed that I had lost the plot
Kept saying that I was not

It will defeat you then teach you to get back up

Your reflection is a blur
Out of focus
But in confusion
The frames are suddenly burnt
And in the end of a roll of illusion
A ghost waiting its turn
Now I can see right through
It's a warning that nobody heard

It will teach you to love what you're afraid of
After it takes away all that
You learn to love
But you don't
Always

LCD Soundsystem,All My Friends (John Cale's Version),3,sad,"That's how it starts
We go back to your house
You check the charts
And start to figure it out

And if it's crowded, all the better
Because we know we're gonna be up late
But if you're worried about the weather
Then you picked the wrong place to stay
That's how it starts

And so it starts
You switch the engine on
We set controls for the heart of the sun
One of the ways that we show our age

And if the sun comes up, if the sun comes up, if the sun comes up
And I still don't wanna stagger home
Then it's the memory of our betters
That are keeping us on our feet

You spent the first five years trying to get with the plan
And the next five years trying to be with your friends again
You're talking 45 turns just as fast as you can
Yeah, I know it gets tired, but it's better when we pretend

And he is fine I won't worry about him
Got the book in his hand.

There's a bitter east wind and the fields are swaying
The crows are round their nests.
I wonder what he's in there saying

And he tied up his helpers and he held the elves hostage
And he ground up poor Rudolph into reindeer sausage!

I need a bishop preaching fire
to get away with my sins
I despise everything I see

Ain't got respect for humanity
Never lived or wanted immortality
The Reaper's shadow I fall upon to obscure my path
Every day I'm being battered up until I bleed
You motherfuckas just leave me be
Ya could never give me cure for the pain I feel inside

I couldn't stand at all
You looked okay with the others

To say hello or goodbye
Or stand the test of time
You did, I just tried to
Separate an ocean from these tears we cried

Then got Totally Krossed Out and Kris Krossed
Who the boss? Niggas get tossed to the side
And I'm the dark side of the Force
Of course it's the Method, Man from the Wu-Tang Clan

Fuck it, two tears in a bucket
Niggas want the ruckus
Bustin' at me, bruh, now bust it

Scorpions crawl across my screen
Make their home beneath my skin
Underneath my dress stick their tongues
Bite through the flesh down to the bone
And I have been so fuckin' alone
Since those three days

Did you only want me for those three days?
Did you only need me for those three days?
Did you love me forever
just for those three days?

You built a nest inside my soul
You rest your head on leaves of gold
You managed to crawl inside my brain
You found a hole and in you came
You sleep like a baby breathing

Wouldn't be ashamed to give her part of my check
Wearin' her cross, I mean the heart on my neck

Her I would reflect on the streets of the Chi'
Ride wit' her, 'cause I know for me, she'd die
Through good and bad call on her like I'm chirpin' her

So I dig a hole and bury pain!

Sick of the same old thing!
So I dig a hole and bury pain!
Sick of the same old thing!
So I dig a hole and bury pain!

Brooks & Dunn,Neon Moon,3,sad,"When the sun goes down on my side of town
That lonesome feelin' comes to my door
The whole world turns blue

There's a rundown bar 'cross the railroad tracks
I've got a table for two-way in the back
Where I sit alone, and think of losing you

I spend most every night beneath the light
Of a neon moon

Now If you lose your one and only
There's always room here for the lonely
To watch your broken dreams dance in and out of the beams
Of a neon moon

I would do better if I could go back
I'm sorry for your tears

It's appetite for hope

Come and see
You mix it all together in your dreams
Ingredients from the Seven Seas, and I
I'm realizing things ain't what they seem
That's the riddle of it, that's the spirit of it
That's the power of life

Rage Against the Machine,Wake Up,0,angry,"Come on

Come on, although you try to discredit
You'll still never edit
The needle, I'll thread it
Radically poetic
Standing with the fury that they had in '66
And like E-Double, I'm mad
Still knee-deep in the system's shit
Hoover, he was a body remover
I'll give you a dose
But it will never come close
To the rage built up inside of me
Fist in the air, in the land of hypocricy

Movements come and movements go
Leaders speak, movements cease
When their heads are flown
'Cause all these punks got bullets in their heads
Departments of police (what?) the judges (what?) the feds

Networks at work, keeping people calm
You know they went after King
When he spoke out on Vietnam
He turned the power to the have-nots
And then came the shot

I'm so free as I'm naked
Shining silver under the moon
I'll fly high above the Moscowite sky
I'm gonna rip, rip, I'll never sleep

How she'd be soothed, how she'd be saved, if he could see
She needs to be held in his arms to be freed
But everything happens for reasons that she will never understand
Till she knows that the heart of a woman

Freshly squashed fly

And how many times did you swear that you'd never love again
How many lonely, sleepless nights
How many lies, how many fights
And why would you want to put yourself through all of that again

""Love is pain"" I hear you say
Love has a cruel and bitter way
Of paying you back for all the faith you ever had in your brain
How could it be that what you need the most
Can leave you feeling just like a ghost
You never want to feel so sad and lost again

One day you could be looking
Through an old book in rainy weather
You see a picture of her smiling at you
When you were still together
You could be walking down the street
And who should you chance to meet
But that same old smile you've been thinking of all day

Why don't we turn the clock to zero, honey
I'll sell the stock, we'll spend all the money
We're starting up a brand new day
Turn the clock all the way back
I wonder if she'll take me back
I'm thinking in a brand new way

Turn the clock to zero, sister

Turn the clock to zero, boss
The river's wide, we'll swim across

Making out that they're okay when they're not
You're gonna like it, but not a lot
And the chorus goes like this

Oh baby, here comes the fear again, oh-oh
The end is near again, oh-oh

Evaporating...

But my eyes remain
Hovering. Witnessing.
Cold as a ghost .watching the streets
Sheltering in doorways of
Venice, Vienna
Budapest, Krakow, and Amsterdam

I have become the invisible man

I have become the invisible man
The invisible heart beating against you

The invisible pulse silently thumping
I shout my name in the public places
No one seems to notice
No one understands
I stand perfectly still
In the middle of the road
I hold my nerve
I hold my nerve
Hold my nerve

Knowing it's so wrong, but feeling so right

If I'm with friends and we should meet

Know the word's discreet with part-time lover
But if there's some emergency
Have a male friend to ask for me
So then she won't peek, it's for you my part-time lover

Kuljen ulkona valossa
Kasvoillani voin tuntea tuulen
Ei sitä tuntunut talossa
Johon palaa en koskaan, luulen
En ole menossa minnekään
Ei missään tule minun luokseni
Minun vuokseni

Vain tahroja paperilla, älä siis suutu
Ei niistä asiat miksikään muutu
Ei se, että meillä oli retkemme
Eikä se, että meillä oli hetkemme

Voi tuuli kylmästi kutittaa selkää

In his bed, I am queen, unobtainable me
Sexual being, human with feelings
The two are not me
The two will not be mine
""And what can you do with a girl
If she refuses to be mine?""

Put his hand on my shirt (Hand on my shirt)

The world is my expense
The cost of my desire
Jesus blessed me with its future
And I protect it with fire

So raise your fists and march around
Just don't take what you need
I'll jail and bury those committed
And smother the rest in greed

Crawl with me into tomorrow
Or I'll drag you to your grave
I'm deep inside your children
They'll betray you in my name

Hey! Hey!

Stacey Kent,The Ice Hotel,2,relaxed,"Breakfast on the Morning Tram
Let's you and me go away to The Ice Hotel
The Caribbean's all booked out
And that's just as well
Once I'd have been much keener
On Barbados or Antigua
But just now I think the Arctic will suit us well
Let's you and me go away to The Ice Hotel

They've built it all with ice that's pure and clear
The sofas, the lobby
Even the chandelier
A thermostat guarantees a steady minus five degrees
What other place could serve our needs so well
Let's you and me go away to the Ice Hotel
Romantic places
Like Verona or Paris
They'll always lead you astray

You got yours, and you got mine

Everybody's just like you, it's true
Everybody wants a good thing too

Willing to try

Can we find a reason
Just think about it

To live another season
Yeah
We're fighting more battles
Everyday we're alive
We should be rejoicing
But instead we cry
This world's so polluted

Son's triflin' fuck, wildflower on the cycle and
Picked up the broom thought I was Michael-in'

Lose an earring in her drink
Leave her jacket in the bathroom stall

Couldn't believe in my eyes

Well, I really blew my cool and you
You just blew out the candle

Time never had a chance to heal your heart
Just a number always counting down to a new start

Then the world will spin around you
Are you dizzy yet?

Respectfully, some honesty I'm calling out
Do you hear the conversation we talk about?
Oh back away to the safety of a quiet house

When your eyes meet mine, we show it

All talk and not a lot to think, we are living dreams

So much is missing without you
But when I start to write again

There's a gap in my life
That's too large to fill
A wound in my heart
That no doctor can heal

There's a ghost in my mind
Who is haunting all night
There is trust deep inside
Brings you back to my side

There's a gap in my life

A wound in my heart
That no doctor can heal

There's a ghost in my mind
Who is haunting all night
There is trust deep inside
Myself deceiving

You've been another colour

Singing and swinging along

Makes you feel this way

She liked his eyes, she wanted more
The baby gonna have your smile for sure
He saw a lovely girl
Smelling sweet and soapy like fresh air
She saw him looking, acted like she didn't care
That's how we knew
And so love grew a flower
A flower that is you

Your daddy knows you're a flame
Your daddy knows you're a flame

Even to the angels it may sound like a lie

Who salute but no one ever does

But, I'm not sick

And I'm so hot
'Cause I'm in hell

Been around the world and found that only stupid people are breeding

Put me in the hospital for nerves and then they had to commit me
You told them all I was crazy

So I'm ready to attack, gonna lead the pack
Gonna get a touchdown, gonna take you out
That's right, put your pom-poms down
Getting everybody fired up

A few times I've been around that track
So it's not just gonna happen like that
'Cause I ain't no hollaback girl
I ain't no hollaback girl

Replace the things that you despise

Pathetic acts for a worthless cause

In the beginning
When we were winning
When our smiles were genuine

In the beginning
When we were winning
When our smiles were genuine

But now unforgiven

That old rusty spaceship wants to sail
Into the milky way again
On a river of red red wine

Kill many, and you're a conqueror
Kill them all... Ooh-oh you're a god!

Would deserve a fat promotion
Want to move ahead

You will know the difference when I touch you

Some people are so phony
Nosy 'cause they're lonely
Aren't you sick of the same thing? (Thing, thing)
They say so and so was dating
Love you or they're hating
When it doesn't matter anyway
'Cause we're here tonight

Amel Larrieux,Weather,2,relaxed,"Whenever you awake and find your kingdom life is great
May I suggest a simple remedy to make your day
Open up your windows and then open wide your eyes
Let the vision feast upon a golden yellow sunrise

You might be aching 'cause the one you love is far away
Thinking it's impossible to make it through another day
You can feel better take it from me
Just look at the colors of the fine autumn leaves
Let them put you at ease

As long as we have the weather
The dark skies will find us
Will send the clear day to remind us
As long as we have the weather
The sunlight will guide us
And the rain most surely will find us

God created chang in seasons not in vain
The beauty of the weather's here
For sum distraction from our pain
Let the warm summers night mist you
Let a winter snow fall entranse you

Dead Kennedys,Holiday in Cambodia,0,angry,"So, you've been to school for a year or two
And you know you've seen it all
In daddy's car, thinking you'll go far
Back east your type don't crawl

Playing ethnicky jazz to parade your snazz
On your five-grand stereo
Braggin' that you know how the niggers feel cold
And the slums got so much soul

It's time to taste what you most fear
Right Guard will not help you here
Brace yourself, my dear
Brace yourself, my dear

It's a holiday in Cambodia
It's tough, kid, but it's life

Play it back, it's going over and over
Give it up and pull me through, all of this to tell you

I've been thinking, take me now, I'm in too far
Can't stop feeling, doesn't matter who you are
This could be my last goodbye
You could stay, I'll be alright

On a plane, I can see the tiny lights below
And oh, my God, they look so alone
Now, do they really feel anything?
Oh, my God, I gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta move on
Where do you move when what you're moving from
Is yourself?

The universe works on a math equation
That never, ever, ever really ends
Infinity spirals out creation on the tip of its tongue
And it is saying
""We ain't sure where you stand

Well, you know how this world can beat you down
And I'm made of clay
I fear I'm the only one who thinks this way

I'm always falling down the same hill
Bamboo puncturing the skin
And nothing comes bleeding out of me
Just like a waterfall I'm drowning in
Two feet below the surface
I can still make out your wavy face
And if I could just reach you
Maybe I could leave this place

I do not want this
I do not want this
I do not want this

And don't you tell me how I feel
Don't you tell me how I feel
Don't you tell me how I feel
You don't know just how I feel

Yo, maybe you didn't break the way you shoulda broke, yo
But I break, know what I'm saying, so
This is how it goes, yo
Damn
Yo

Last year, Valentine's day
You would just warmly say
""Babe, I love you, love you (Yo, he's lying) babe I swear""
Held you when you were sick, even
The whole time I think to myself, this isn't fair

What is this I see (No)
You don't come home to me (Oh, no)
When you don't come home to me (Man)
Can't deal, can't bear
You keep tellin' me lies
But to your surprise
Look, I found her red coat and your
Caught out there

I hate you so much right now
I hate you so much right now
Aah
I hate you so much right now
I hate you so much right now
I hate you so much right now

Scissor Sisters,She's My Man,1,happy,"This town was built on muddy stilts
By the lunatic parade
It rains like revelations
Gonna wash these freaks away
Some girls wanna hold your hand
And some girls like to pray
Well my girl takes her drinks
With dust and rusty razor blades

As I lie between these covers
I wanna tell her that I love it
When she chokes me in the

Backseat of her riverboat 'cause

She's my man
And we got all the balls we need
When you taste that pavement
You're amazed
She smells your sympathy
So bye bye ladies
May the best queen hold the crown
For the most bush sold on the levee
My my, how word gets around
She strangles for a good time
And she kills my self-control

She's my man, don't be too sad sonny
'Cause she'll never be your woman no more

Flew one thousand jets
We laughed and we cried at movies and real life

Music would play and Felina would whirl

Blacker than night were the eyes of Felina
Wicked and evil while casting a spell
My love was deep for this Mexican maiden
I was in love, but in vain I could tell

One night, a wild young cowboy came in
Wild as the West Texas wind
Dashing and daring, a drink he was sharing
With wicked Felina, the girl that I loved
So in anger

I challenged his right for the love of this maiden
Down went his hand for the gun that he wore
My challenge was answered in less than a heartbeat
The handsome young stranger lay dead on the floor

Just for a moment, I stood there in silence
Shocked by the foul evil deed I had done

A broken shell
Straight shackled onto the floor

So welcome to the world
That I lived in
Puking up bile and hate
My world has turned
To false inclusion
Sickening broken state

But then I'd see
There's things in me
That make me want it
More than you

But I deny all this
'Cause pain was my bliss
Get wasted on self-destruct

So hold on to the edge

It's all about
The blood, the sweat, the tears
Attribute to the strength

Is comin' through with nuff niggaz
And nuff guns
So if you wanna come sweatin'
Stressin' contestin'
You'll catch a sharp sword to the midsection
Don't talk the talk, if you can't walk the walk
Phony niggaz are outlined in chalk
A man vexed
Is what the projects made me
Rebel to the grain there's no way to barricade me
Steamrollin' niggas like a eighteen wheeler
With the drunk driver drivin'
There's no survivin'

Ruff like Timberland wear, yea
Me and the clan
And, yo, the landcruisers out there
Peace to all the crooks
All the niggaz with bad looks
Bald heads, braids, blow this hook
We got chrome teks, nickel plated macs
Black ac's, drug dealin' styles in phat stacks
I only been a good nigga for a minute though
'Cuz I got to get my props, and win it, yo
I got beef wit commercial ass niggaz with gold teeth
Lampin' in a Lexus eatin' beef

Don't give a fuck if I cut my arm bleeding
Do you even care if I die bleeding?

Would it be wrong, would it be right?
If I took my life tonight
Chances are that I might
Mutilation out of sight
And I'm contemplating suicide

'Cause I'm losing my sight, losing my mind
Wish somebody would tell me I'm fine
Losing my sight, losing my mind
Wish somebody would tell me I'm fine

But it is She who has infected me for all eternity

As the sun slips the tearaway stars
Into the scented scheme of night
I kissed her mouth like a dark red rose
Set upon a marbled dream of white
So pure of thought like a Vestal statue
Jewelled with a God-lent grace
I was close to coming when She bid adieu
Fuelled by the heartache rent upon her face there

Oh Mina, obscener
Thoughts obsess my days
Oh Mina, obscener
Thoughts possess me that I must now obey

They say the darkest hour is that before the dawn
When nothing in one's power
Can dissipate the great forlorn

Then you might as well take the sun away
All the birds that flew in the summer sky
When our love was new, and our hearts were high
And the day was young, and the night was long
And the moon stood still for the night bird's song

If you go away
If you go away
If you go away

But if you stay, I'll make you a day
Like no day has been, all will be again
We'll sail the sun, we'll ride on the rain
And talk to the trees, and worship the wind

Then, if you go, I'll understand
Leave me just enough love to fill up my hand

And at the same time my mouth was whistling a sextet from Luicini
And at the same time What do you think my foot was doing?
While keeping time it was cracking walnuts; see I had to eat too.
Then in the midst of all soliloquy
I found it, I found it
The Lost Chord, The Lost Chord!

Where we'll go, baby I don't know
Maybe we should just let nature run the show

I don't wanna watch no movie

Until I realize that it was you who held me under

Felt it in my fist, in my feet, in the hollows of my eyelids
Shaking through my skull, through my spine
And down through my ribs

No more calling like a crow for a boy, for a body in the garden
No more dreaming like a girl so in love, so in love
No more dreaming like a girl so in love, so in love
No more dreaming like a girl, so in love with the wrong world

Love is a verb and a noun as well
You find it in a dictionary under 'L'
To give you a description to spell it out
But they don't say what it's all about

Love is a fire that you can't control
It burns in the middle and it leaves a hole

To haunt of the wide earth a spot
To which I could not love the less
So lovely was the loneliness
Of a wild lake, with black rock bound
And the tall trees that towered around

But when the night had thrown her pall
Upon that spot as upon all
And the wind would pass me by
In its stilly melody

My infant spirit would awake
To the terror of the lone lake
My infant spirit would awake
To the terror of the lake

Heaven opens a magic lane
When all the clouds darken up the skyway
There's a rainbow highway to be found
Leading from your window pane
To a place beyond the sun
Just a step behind the rain

Two acres of field and a gas station
Riding on my moped, looking for fun
Staring into the blood-red sun
Oh, the country road is a boulevard
With neon lights and night-open bars
In my jacket, pack of playing cards
Just jacks, jokers, and a queen of hearts

My heart is beating, beating like Ringo
As I pull into the drive-in bingo

Why do the people in the country want to look like the people in the city
When the people in the city aren't the slightest pretty?
I want the people in the country to wear flannel shirts
And saggy jeans all covered in dirt

Always gonna live at home with mom and pop

In this life of police chases, street sweepers and coppers
Stick-up kids with no conscience, leavin' victims with doctors
If you really think you ready to die with .9s out
This is what Nas is 'bout, nigga, the time is now!

Yo, all I need is one mic
All I need is one mic (that's all I need)
All I need is one mic (all I need, niggas)

Out of the dim and the gloom we came
We are animals

From the primordial soup
Out of the dim and the gloom we came
We are animals
One unbroken chain

I need to get you out of your cave, man
I need to let you out of your cage and set you free
If tonight's the night
I'm gonna show you I ain't got no game plan

Out from under a rock
From a prehistoric sea, we crawl
We are animals
Animal, one and all

Out from under a rock
From the prehistoric sea we came
We are animals, animal

Always running up the alley

Wanted dead or alive is my profile
Hostile is the frame for my state of grace
Severely a mental disorder
Where reality is highly distorted
Psychosis - weaken the mind
Incline to small doses as we approach this
Ever endless quest for a vengeance
While those who expose and pretend this
Life is just a big bowl of cherries
A bunch of fairies screaming to be scary

It's propaganda
Sell it to the innocent
Oh yeah, they're buying it
Just tell them to rebel again

With no way to hold my head, that didn't hurt
And the beer I had for breakfast wasn't bad,
So I had one more for dessert.
Then I fumbled in my closet through my clothes
And found my cleanest dirty shirt.
Then I washed my face and combed my hair
And stumbled down the stairs to meet the day.

I'd smoked my mind the night before
With cigarettes and the songs I'd been pickin'
But I lit my first and watched a small kid
Playin' with a can that he was kicking
Then I walked across the street
And caught the Sunday smell of someone's fryin' chicken

But I guess that doesn't cut it

Where I almost did five years and then seven more

Because he almost made off with a bunch of the drugs

It's gotten so bad, there's just no more anger
So now it seems like we can't get no further
I can't believe I'll be bright for another

I'll be the switch she turns on
She'll be mine too, I get off
I'll be the fuse that she blows
And even with the lights out
We'll glow, oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-whoa-oh, oh-oh

Under the moon and with the girl that's in your place
And even Edison has no idea

The black Air Force sergeant was not the first one
And all of the drugs she took, every one, every one

Toasted over flames, they be tasting quite right

All hail King Neptune and his water-breathers

How I felt the Lord in my father's house

And I can see, I can see
Standing, we were seventeen, make it clean
Are you the living ghost of what I need?
Are you getting the best of me?
We will see

'Cause I'm done being done with a funeral
At least for now
Are you tired of being alone?
Are you tired of being alone?

Shake it out, shake it out
Tired of another and another wasn't really what I wanted
So we bled it out

I guess I blew up quick

See me as a premie, but I'm not, and my nuts big
I don't know what the fuss is, my career is illustrious
My rep is impeccable; I'm not to be fucked with, with

I'm way too important to be talking about extorting
Asking me for a portion's like asking for a coffin
Broad daylight I'll off your on-switch

Bye bye, my reply, ""Blah, blah""
Blast burner, then pass burner to Ty-Ty
Finish my breakfast, why?
I got an appetite for destruction and you're a small fry

There's a light, white light

Life is ours, we do it our way

Never cared for what they do, no

Fall onto your knees

Nothin' worse could ever happen
Seeing you with someone else proved that I was wrong
And when your eyes met mine
I knew that you were gone forever
Along with all the reasons, I had for hanging on""

On a slow train back to Georgia
Or in the grey walls of a prison doing time
I think I'd rather die
And go to hell and face the devil

Me and my friend made a comic book

And it's time to reverse the roles
Now I just wanna make good on
All the promises I have made

Up on the shore they work all day
Out in the sun they slave away
While we devotin'
Full time to floatin'

Down here all the fish is happy
As off through the waves they roll
The fish on the land ain't happy

But fish in the bowl is lucky
They in for a worser fate
One day when the boss get hungry
Guess who's gon' be on the plate

Lard! It's in all of us, man. Our pores, and in our hair.
Lard! What we conceal in those corny clothes we wear.

Lard is all.
Lard is divine.
Lard is in control.
Lard whips and chains our soul.
We carry credit cards.
We live in fear of art.
Lard is the Om.
Lard is revolution.
Lard is the tapeworm,
in the bottle of cheap tequila.
That comes alive at night,
And sneaks up and bite our nipples.

Lard.
Lard!

Nowadays, most of us need someone to run our personal life.
Someone to see that the plant are watered.
Someone to make sure the place is clean.
Someone to make sure dinner is waiting.
Someone to call for theater tickets.
Some one to make up those cheap excuses.
What we need is Lard!

Lard!

The answer.
The dancer.
The ointment.
The dream.

And young enough not to say no

To any chance that she gets
For home plate tickets to see the Mets
Like everybody, she's in over her head

Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds,Far From Me,3,sad,"For you dear, I was born
For you I was raised up
For you I've lived and for you I will die
For you I am dying now
You were my mad little lover
In a world where everybody fucks everybody else over
You who are so far from me
Far from me
So far from me
Way across some cold neurotic sea
Far from me

I would talk to you of all matter of things
With a smile you would reply
Then the sun would leave your pretty face

You're a loud mouth bitch, and a big talker

Jonathan Coulton,Ikea,1,happy,"Long ago in days of yore
It all began with a god named Thor
There were Vikings and boats
And some plans for a furniture store
It's not a bodega, it's not a mall
And they sell things for apartments smaller than mine
As if there were apartments smaller than mine

Ikea (Ikea), just some oak and some pine and a handful of Norsemen
Ikea (Ikea), selling furniture for college kids and divorced men
Everyone has a home
But if you don't have a home, you can buy one there

So rent a car or take the bus

And a vicious wind blew hard and fast
I should have taken it as a warning

As a warning

As a warning

I'd given my nurse the weekend off
My meals were ill prepared
My typewriter had turned mute as a tomb
And my piano crouched in the corner of my room
With all it's teeth bared

All it's teeth bared
All it's teeth bared
All it's teeth bared

I left my house without my coat
Something my nurse would not have allowed
And I took the small roads out of town
And I passed a cow and the cow was brown
And my pajamas clung to me like a shroud

Like a shroud

Talkin' bout the way

I liked how that shit was goin' down
Dreamt about ripping the mic with my own sound
So I tried to write rhymes

""That ain't you Ice

That shit sounds like them.""
So I sat back, thought up a new track
Didn'T fantasize, kicked the pure
Facts. Motherfuckers got scared
Cause they weas unprepaired
Who would tell it how it relly was?
Who dared?
A motherfucker from the West Coast
L.A. South Central fool
Where the Crips and the Bloods play

Why play ya blind?

And anyone with two cents
Would know I'm

Rappin' bout hardcore topics
Over hardcore drum beats
A little different

Jet you thru the fast lane
Drop ya on death row
Cause anybody who's been there
Knows that life ain't sho lovely
On the blood-soaked fast track
That invincible shit don't work
Throw ya in a joint
You'll be comin' out feet first

Une lueur scintille dans la nuit,
Et l'ange tombe du haut des cieux,
Les ailes déchirées par son dieu,
Une goutte de plus parmi les pluies.

Son corps a traversé les nuages,
Pour atterrir sur terre, tremblant,
D'un ange, il ne reste plus que le visage,
La pureté de son teint blanc.

L'homme pauvre sera attristé,
Mais du paradis est venue la haine,
Il ne reste plus, sur son visage blême,
Que malheurs et souffrances ignorés.

Oh, my old man's a dustman

In his great big hobnail boots
He's got such a job to pull them up
That he calls 'em daisy roots

Some folks give tips at Christmas
And some of them forget
So when he picks their bins up
He spills some on the step

Now one old man got nasty
And to the council wrote
Next time my old man went 'round there
He punched him up the throat

Oh, my old man's a dustman

He wears cor-blimey trousers

In a case of mistaken identity I gave these things to you
I sound angry, bitter, sad, infatuated, it's the truth
Denial, anger, bargaining, depression, just a few
Stages of acceptance that it's really over
It's just so complicated, I'm stupid for believing in you

You make me feel like my father never loved me
You make me feel like the act of love is empty
Am I so unlovable?
Is my skin untouchable?
Do I remind you of a part of you that you don't like?

I had your back, I held you up, I told you you were good enough
It was never reciprocated, you kept affection and then yourself apart
You fed your love to me like crumbs to pigeons in the park
Sometimes I think it satisfied you seeing me begging like a dog

I put my faith in God and my trust in you

Wish there was something true
Wish there was something real
In this world full of you

I'm the one without a soul
I'm the one with this big fucking hole

I have done all that I'll stand for

Your hair and face against the mirror
As I take the steps to save what's left of me
Someone's out when it's over

People steal from you
And they take anything they choose

It's good to see you
I missed you last night
That's such a lovely color
It goes with your eyes
Before we fall asleep
I just wanted to say
This all seems so easy
But there's choices to make

Can't decide, then look at the faces

Where the grass is green and the girls are pretty

Pero es distinto conformarse o pelear, no es lo mismo, es distinto

No es lo mismo ""arte"" que ""hartar""
No es lo mismo ser justo, que ¡qué justo te va! Verás
No es lo mismo tú que otra, entérate, no es lo mismo
Que sepas que hay gente que trata de confundirnos
Pero tenemos corazón que no es igual, lo sentimos, es distinto

Vale, que a lo mejor me lo merezco, bueno
Pero mi voz no te la vendo, puerta
Y lo que opinen de nosotros, léeme los labios, yo no estoy en venta
Vale, que a lo mejor lo merecemos, bueno
Pero la voz no la vendemos, puerta
Y lo que opinen de nosotros, léeme los labios, a mí me vale madre

Puerta y aire que me asfixio que no se trata del lado que quieras estar
Que estar de un lado o echarte a un lado, verás, no sé como decirte, no es lo mismo
Vivir es lo más peligroso que tiene la vida
Que digan por televisión, que hay suelto un corazón que no es igual, que es peligroso, que es distinto

And I'll show you magic (What? What?)
Magic
I got the magic stick

I'm a freak to the core
Get a dose once you gonna want some more
My tongue touch you girl, your toes bound to curl
This exclusive stick I don't share with the world
I had you up early in the mornin' moanin'
Back shots proper the law can't stop us

Been a fiend for this since Rakeim made hits
Get the position down pat then its time to switch
I rock the boat, I'll work the middle
I speed it up, straight beat it up

And I ain't in the hood with my toast out loc'n
I'm in the telly workin' up a sweat strokin'
Tonight's the night you could fall in love
You could call your mama right now tell her you met a thug
I pop alot of shit 'cause I can back it up
My left stroke's the death stroke

I got the magic clit
I know if I get licked once, I get licked twice
I am the baddest chick
Shorty you don't believe me, then come with me tonight
And I'll show you magic (What? What?)

In my dream of laughter
You came creeping with your fears
Telling me your sorrows
In the trace ends of your tears

That's a strange way to tell me you love me
When your sorrow is all I can see
If you just want to cry to somebody
Don't cry to me, no
Don't cry to me, no

Up my hipty-dipty-dip?

Who was that man?
He shoved it up my can
And left me stranded on this Christmas tree. (Yeah ...)

Mustard, hot sauce, light bread, and french fries
Love for the big guy
Hit the park, boys showin' off their hops
Nappy Roots on the radio and you know it bops
Last night I hit the pick tree bought some Air Force Ones
Four tall tees, man I love the B.G.

Despite the infection within

Never minding the fragile dirt we all end in

To each his own on the level of that moment
But it's your moment, and you know you'll fucking own it

Glorified and embraced by your victory
When you're done, you escape with that memory
Blindfolded through this life as we learn
And consequences when the wrong page is turned

It's an E! True Hollywood Story
Take a man down with his own glory
Now, guess who's next

At some point, we come down from the highs
And so be it, we move on with our lives
'Cause some of us let the laughs cover cries
Do the math, you can laugh when I die

If life is just a fantasy, then could you
Live this fantasy life? If so, then would you?

I asked him what the problem was
He says, here's your disguise

Now he's hardly getting over it

Now he's hardly getting over it

Down by the railroad tracks
Got no paper on his pocket
Got no paper on his back

It is another hungry mouth to feed

Or he'll grow to be an angry young man some day
Take a look at you and me
Are we too blind to see?
Do we simply turn our heads

Venite in paradiso
Là dove vado anch'io
Perché non c'è l'inferno
Nel mondo del buon Dio

She a delta so she been throwing that dynasty sign
No use me tryna be lying

Trying to be a millionaire
How I used two lifelines?

In the same hospital where Biggie Smalls died

I thank you Lord for my birth, and everything that's followed
I thank you Lord for today, and I will pray for tomorrow

I made a promise and I'm loving my wife to the end
I thank you Lord for your guidance, 'cause it's all that counts
And right here, right now, Lord, this is your house
I thank you Lord for a dream that came true to light
And I ask you to bless everybody, in this room tonight
I don't always do the right thing, and I ask you to forgive me
'Cause I need you here with me, without You in my life it's empty
I think back how some people did me like, violence was the remedy
And because I think of that now, I pray for my enemy
Not because of what I'll do, but because they don't know
There's something better after here, but everybody, won't go
So I ask you to forgive them, and we'll hope they see
And I thank you for the love that, they've given to me
I will not abuse it, nor will I lead them astray
You see I love them like children, that I see everyday
And I pray, no we pray, together
Get us through the bad weather, and we'll love you forever
Let your thought and my heart, go hand in hand
I first thought, but to start, but I stand a man
And for as long as I can, as long as you permit me
Please give me, the strength I need to live, bear with me
Amen

We each walk the path, that we've chosen

I'm ready to meet him
We're I'm living ain't right
Black hate white
White hate black
It's right back
To the same fight
They got us suspecting a war
But the real war is to follow the law of the lord

Lord, you left me stranded
And I don't know why
Told me to live my life
Now I'm ready to die
Ready to fly
I cry, but I shed no tears
You told me you would dead those fears, it's been years
Snakes still coming at me
Just missing
Sometimes I think all you doing me is just listen
I thought that I was special
That's what you told me
Hold me
Stop acting like you don't know me
What I do so bad that it sent you away from me
Not only sent you away, but made you stay away from me
(My child I'm here, as I've always been, it was you who went away
And now are back again, what did I say)
Follow your word, and be true

And the moment you dirt her skin with your fingers
You will be sentenced the same
Every second with her I count
And for every second you will suffer too

Traces poisons all impure
Profane the haunted heaven
Jeering leapt into the pit of calamity

The Doors,Celebration of the Lizard,0,angry,"LIONS IN THE STREET

Lions in the street and roaming
Dogs in heat, rabid, foaming
A beast caged in the heart of a city
The body of his mother
Rotting in the summer ground.
He fled the town.

He went down South and crossed the border
Left the chaos and disorder
Back there over his shoulder.

One morning he awoke in a green hotel
With a strange creature groaning beside him.
Sweat oozed from its shiny skin.

Is everybody in?
The ceremony is about to begin.

WAKE UP

Wake up!
You can't remember where it was.
Had this dream stopped?

The snake was pale gold
Glazed & shrunken.
We were afraid to touch it.
The sheets were hot dead prisons.

And she was beside me.
Old she is not... young
Her dark red hair.
Her white soft skin.

Now, run to the mirror in the bathroom,
Look!
She is coming in here.
I can't live thru each slow century of her moving.
I let my cheek slide down
The cool smooth tile
Feel the good cold stinging blood
The smooth hissing snakes of rain...

A LITTLE GAME

Once I had a little game
I liked to crawl back into my brain
I think you know the game I mean
I mean the game called 'go insane'

Now you should try this little game
Just close your eyes forget your name
Forget the world, forget the people
And we'll erect a different steeple.

This little game is fun to do.
Just close your eyes, no way to lose.
And I'm right thre, I'm going too.
Release control, we're breaking through.

Letting someone into my misery

I told it all step by step

How I landed on the island
And how I swim across the sea
And it crosses my mind
That I may awake to a knife in me
No more breath in my hair, or ladies underwear
Tossed up over the alarm clock
Blood dripping from the bed to a neatly written poem
A heartfelt last line reading
There is no more mystery
Is it gonna happen, my love?

There is no more mystery
Is it gonna happen, my love?
It's all in my head, she said, ""Morning after nightmare
""You're building a wall,"" she said, ""higher than the both of us

Time to give ourselves to strange gods' hands

A dark flak spiders bursting in the sky
Reaching twisted claws on every side
No place to run

peacock caw the sound of my lover's name

your fire burns for me

Running faster than my legs can take me
Shouting louder than my lungs allow me

Wide as the rivers run
Still got time for someone

Light a match, bring the flame over to your eye
Slipping past, you won't see me before you die
Breaking down our sleep, my head's still aching
This war is killing you and all around me

In the distance, I hear them devouring
Pest ridden jackals of the earth
Diabolical beasts and roaming the forests
In wait and constant protectors
Calling you to sit by his side
Your self loathing image in his flesh
A revelation upon which you linger

His words are flies
Swarming towards the true insects
Feasting on buried dreams
And spreading decay upon your skin
His eyes spew forth a darkness
That cut through and paralyze
Casts light upon your secrets
Forced to confront your enemies

His mouth is a vortex
Sucking you into it's pandemonium
Fools you with a helping hand of ashes
Reached out in false dismay
His body is a country

'Tis the last of all the land
A dweller upon our lonesome isle

On weary night, under stars
He'd often lay and gaze
Up towards the moon and stars
The sun's dying haze

Time and again, Orion's light
Filled our man with joy
Within the belt, he'd see his love
Remembering her voice

Such is life upon the isle
Of torment and woe
One day good, one day bad
And some days, even hope

The light at the end of the world
Burns bright for mile and mile
Yet tends the man, its golden glow
In misery all the while?

And I'm not comes as no surprise
But don't expect me to be happy for you
And don't smile at me and tell me things will work out for me too
I don't want your pity
I hate your pity

Taste your vanity and sweet bitterness
As you hide behind your veil of
I watched you steal my thoughts (my stolen hopes and lost dreams)
You took them all (and had to see you smile)

As you build your dreams on my shattered hopes
I'll look back on a day once loved
And fantasize for tragedy
Swallow your pity

So follow me down (follow me down)
Take this all the way

Why don't you say so?
I think I'm caught in between
The nights and days fly by when I'm lost on the streets
And my eyes, they despise you for who I am
Why don't you say so?
Why don't you say so?

Lately I've been wishin' the television set
Would show me more than just a picture of
The things I've grown to detest
I strip down my dignity
They can take all of me

Wishing you were there

You crossed your heart you'd quit

Your promise for my ring
Now just like back to grade school
You're doing the same old thing

Stop! The love you save may be your own
Darling, take it slow
Or some day you'll be all alone
You'd better stop! The love you save may be your own
Darling, look both ways before you cross me
You're headed for the danger zone

I'm the one who loves you
I'm the one you need
Those other guys will put you down
As soon as they succeed

They'll ruin your reputation
They'll label you a flirt
The way they talk about you

The waters whisper
Of something brooding.
No way out of here.

Slow smouldering,
Slow raining heat.
Lapping at your skin
Pulling you down again.

I wish that I could
Fan back to life
The dying embers
Of my long lost passion.

Descending deeper.
With black as my light.
With twist and turn.
All men will be tried in life.

We look for light to call.
The call to save us all.
Lest we fall to our knees.
The death, we kiss his feet.
Oh, sacred mother come.
For our fate is done.
In blindness do we run
Always backwards.

Andrew Bird,Armchairs,2,relaxed,"I dreamed you were a cosmonaut
Of the space between our chairs
And I was a cartographer
Of the tangles in your hair

I sighed a song that silence brings
It's the one that everybody knows
Oh everybody knows
The song that silence sings
And this was how it goes

These looms that weave apocryphal
They're hanging from a strand
These dark and empty rooms were full
Of incandescent hands

Awkward pause
A fatal flaw
Time, it's a crooked bow
Oh, time's a crooked bow

You tell me that I'm lucky

If you don't know what you've got

You throw it away, throw it away
All the heart and the soul I've been givin'
You throw it away, throw it away

Getting bigger and sleeker and wider and brighter
We bite and scratch and scream all night
Let's go and throw all the songs we know

Into the sea, you and me
All the years and no one heard
I'll show you in spring, it's a treacherous thing

Wonderfully, wonderfully pretty
Oh, you know that I'd do anything for you

From the floor I found a life I lead today

Well, they can take, take, take the kids from the summer
But they'll never, never, never take the summer from me
It was the very first time that I lost my mind for a week

They can make, make, make me forget the weather
If they'll never, never, never wash the sand from my feet
It was the very last time that we said goodbye to the beach

It's like a thousand rainy nights

Slap me with a splintered ruler

If only I could hunt the hunter

And all I really want is some patience
A way to calm the angry voice
And all I really want is deliverance

But I guess it's a test in this quest for happiness
and the rest of that mess so I'd best just aquiescue
Even though I've grown tired of you

And that ain't meant sound spiteful
I'm just trying to be insightful
When I write all my emotions in the night
All the stuff I try to fight will just come out
And the sad fact is; I'm so tired of you

Love, It's a weird thing ain't it?
There's no way to explain it
But I swear as well as pain
There should be joy but we sustain
the same level of mundane
And it's numbing me through

I Often wonder if I'd miss you
As to have the urge to kiss you
When an issue has to hit through
To this heart that now feels disused
And said issue was to big to just ignore

Departing from Los Angeles, final destination to St. Louis
Thank you

Damn G, the spot's gettin hot
So how the fuck am I supposed to make a knot?
Police looking at niggaz through a microscope
In L.A. everybody and they momma sell dope
They trying to stop it
So what the fuck can I do to make a profit?
Catch a flight to St. Louis
That's cool, 'cause nobody knew us
We stepped off the plane
Four gang bangers, professional crack slangers

Rented a car at Wholesale
Drove to the ghetto, and checked in a motel
Unpacked and I grabbed the 3.80
Cos where we staying, niggaz look shady
But they can't fade South Central
'Cause busting a cap is fundamental
Peeping out every block close
Seeing which one will clock the most
Yeah, this is the one, no doubt
Bust a U Bone, and let's clear these niggaz out

(Hey! Hey man! Whassup nigga? This is Lynch Mob nigga)

Now clearing them out meant casualties
Still had the L.A. mentality
Bust a cap, and outta there in a hurry
Wouldn't you know, a drive-by in Missouri
Them fools got popped
Took their corner next day, set up shop
And it's better than slanging in the Valley
Triple the profit making more than I did in Cali'
Breaking up rocks like Barney Rubble
'Cause them mark-ass niggaz don't want trouble

And all the dreams that I laid to rest
Are ghosts that keep me
After all that I've become

Will she still be with us

Leap year is late
How did you get here
Ask all but the bait
From a Christ that went hissing
Constricting his cells

We summon by candle by book and by bell

Glossolalia coats my skin
Glycerin and turbulence

Stuffed the voice inside of God
Mirrors to the animals
Glossolalia coats my skin

The sermon goes mourning
Pricking its hail
Slothful the child

That preys on the seed
Shall behead the drought
Wound under sleeves
I hope you have room
In a thicket of vines
Give me a moment

To claim what you've stole
The streets will hang high
Stretched ribs and let taste
We'll cover the smell with silver nitrate

Mending the cuts of your prosthetic faith

Stuffed the voice inside of God
Mirrors to the animals

And homemade butter on the bread
But the best darn thing about Grandma's house
Was her great big feather bed

It was nine feet high and six feet wide
Soft as a downy chick
It was made from the feathers of forty-eleven geese
Took a whole bolt of cloth for the tick
It'd hold eight kids and four hound dogs
And a piggy we stole from the shed
We didn't get much sleep, but we had a lot of fun
On Grandma's feather bed

After supper, we'd sit around the fire

The Judas I hang with, the guilt of betraying Christ
You murdered and stole his religion, and painting him white
Translated in psychologically tainted philosophy

Just stop turning and be real still

If I could tell ya, yeah, the way that I feel
Would you believe enough in magic
And carnival wheels?

Life is never say you? re sorry

David Ford,Laughing Aloud,2,relaxed,"Eight weeks in the city,
And you've never looked so pale,
They say the pure of heart don't stand a chance,
And you'd better learn to swim,
'Cos there will be rainy days.

I'm blinded the brake lights,
Well there's nothing moving here,
And all your burning questions, they just get answered with another one,
And there's no help at all.

So question me no questions,
It's a pointless enterprise,
You ask and i'll only tell you what i think you want to hear,
oh mind the whitest lies.

'Cos the truth,
Well it's for students for philosophy,
And faith is for losers like us,
And secrets are for people who intend to get away with being in the wrong,
So don't you breath a word.

But save your breath,
For the laughing aloud, again.
Save your breath,
For the talking all night, oh.
Save you breath,
For the laughing aloud, again.
Save your breath,

Save your breath.

Will you listen to their bleeding hearts?
Pretend to show concern,
And so we glanced our watches and join in as everybody sings,
Oh what have we become?

Take a swing with a bag, and they wait
By the school gate

Forsake everything

And it's choking me

There's a bird in the chimmney and a stone in my bed
When the road's washed out, we pass the bottle around
And wait in the arms of the cold, cold ground

While you burn at the stake, I dance with the flames

A worthless handshake, the slickest thief, I steal your wealth
I answer your prayers for greed and lust
More than evil, I laugh at your trust

I am more powerful than all the armies of the world
I am more violent than violence, more deadly than death
I have destroyed more men than all the nation's wars
I am relentless, unpredictable, waiting for your last breath

He ate my pussy from dark till the mornin
Called his girl up and told her we was bonin
Puerto Rican papi, used to be a Deacon

And this black dude I called King Kong
He had a big ass dick and a hurricane tongue

Är född en lördag klockan fem
Jag längtar alltid härifrån men aldrig hem

Mando Diao,Clean Town,1,happy,"We gonna run now

You wanna worship it's feelings
The ones who's squeezing the shame from every man
If mama says it's dinner time, if she ruins your love, run away
So you live in a prison, oh so you're wasting your life
Oh on a system you never will understand
Are you the one I dreamed of, man

Clean town if you want to get away
You pack your cases and you hope for a better day
Mama's alright she said she didn't want your love
Clean town if you want to get away
You pack your cases and you hope for a better day
Joni's alright she said she didn't want your love, yeah

Won't you walk down the main street

Did you drink their well dry? And extinguish all their sunshine?
I didn't say that I felt the same, you just took it as read
As I closed all the blinds and put you to bed
And read you all the last rites.

It serves as a warning to me, just like most of these days do
Cos I just wish I coulda just left you there sitting in your own shit
Cos I know that you would me, too
See, cos I've trawled through all this before
And I bought that skinny tee
With a big black gaping hole where the heart should be
That says, ""baby, I renounce thee""

'Cause love's the greatest healer to be found.
So leave me if you need to,
But I will still remember,
Angel flying too close to the ground.

Deeply twined inside of her mind
A tried and confined egret
That pines to fly south
To this mouth of mine

Pity

Too long have these emotions
Like potions, made me
A sole castellan
Trusted to keep
The weight of oceans
From her rusted gates of sleep

A dreaming angel
Lying curled in the circles of Hell
I must protect her
Watch her back for any cracks to occur
For in the witching hour
She slips into the underworld
A pearled Persephone
Deflowered by the powers
Hat around her
Down her
Whirl

Doomed to damn the rift
Across the shifting abyss
With her body and it? s gift
My filthy little secret

A plan of dignity and balance for all

Backed in a corner, caught up in the race
Means to an end ended in disgrace
Perspective is lost in the spirit of the chase

Foreclosure of a dream

Until all is lost, personal holocaust
Foreclosure of a dream

Barren land that once filled a need
Are worthless now, dead without a deed
Slipping away from an iron grip
Nature's scales are forced to tip

The Arrogant Worms,Johnny Came Home Headless,1,happy,"Johnny was a tall man, but his memory was short.
He'd forget to duck at doorways, and often he'd get hurt.
I took good care of him for he had no family.
Accually he did but he forgot who they be.
Johnny often liked to go out on the town.
He'd forget where he'd be going, so he'd just wander 'round.

Of his head hitting the doorway, but one night it was a lack.

Johnny came home headless.
It was a great disgrace,
But where ever it's a'lying
There's a smile upon his face.

He'd finally lost his mind,
But if his head don't turn up soon
then all his hats are mine.

Johnny came towards me, but suddenly he stopped,
As if trying to think of something but having no luck,
'Cause still he didn't notice that his head weren't there,

Grit my teeth, spray 'til every nigga's gone
Got my block sewn, armored dope spots
Last thing I sweat's a sucka punk cop
Move like a king when I roll, hops
You try to flex, bang, another nigga drops
You gotta deal with this 'cause there's no way out
Why? Cash money ain't never gonna play out

I got nothin' to lose, much to gain
In my brain, I got a capitalist migraine
I gotta get paid tonight, you muthafuckin' right
Thinkin' my grip, check my bitch, keep my game tight
So many hoes on my jock, think I'm a movie star
Nineteen, I got a fifty thousand dollar car
Go to school, I ain't goin' for it
Kiss my ass, bust the cap on the Moet
'Cause I don't wanna hear that crap
Why? I'd rather be a New Jack hustler

Look at that ring right there
I know it's real, it's gotta be real
Man, you the flyest nigga I seen in my life
Yo man, I just wanna roll with you man
How can I be down?

What's up, you say you wanna be down?
Ease back, or muthafucka get beat down
Out my face, fool, I'm the illest
Bulletproof, I die harder than Bruce Willis
Got my crew in effect, I bought 'em new Jags
So much cash, gotta keep it in Hefty bags

Images scar my mind
Four weeks felt like years
Since your full attention was all mine

The night was young and so were we
Talked about life, God, death and your family
Didn't want any promises
Just my undivided honesty

And say, oh, whoa
Things are gonna change now, for the better
And oh, whoa, things are gonna change
Oh, they're gonna change

I am the Patron Saint of Lost Causes
A fraction of who I once believed
Change, only a matter of time
Opinions, I will try and rewrite

If life had background music
Playing your song
I've got to be honest, I tried to escape you
But the orchestra plays on

And they sing, oh, whoa
Things are gonna change now, for the better
And oh, whoa, things are gonna change

Hands, like secrets
Are the hardest thing to keep from you
Lines and phrases, like knives
Your words can cut me through

Dismantle me down
Repair
You've dismantled me
You've dismantled me

Hands, like secrets
Are the hardest thing to keep from you
Lines and phrases, like knives

And 'fuck tha police' in the tape deck
You should listen to me cuz there's more to see
Call my neighborhood a ghetto cuz it houses minorities
The other color don't know you can run but not hide
These are tales from the darkside...

A place so far away from you

I leave my heart open but it stays right here empty for days
She told me in the morning she don't feel the same about us in her bones
It seems to me that when I die these words will be written on my stone
And I'll be gone gone tonight
The ground beneath my feet is open wide
The way that I been holdin' on too tight
With nothing in between
The story of my life I take her home
I drive all night to keep her warm and time
Is frozen (the story of, the story of)
The story of my life I give her hope
I spend her love until she's broke inside

Out on the sea in a great big boat

And we had our god and it may seem odd
But at least there was a cause

Caught a wind and we upped the sail
Lost two ships when it turned to a gale

I don't want to work
I want to bang on the drum all day (yes, I do)
I don't want to play

She caught me pounding on the desk with my hands
But my licks was so hot

I can't last 'til night turns to day
I can't find the words to say
It all stops when kingdom comes
And you can't hide in your grave

Suddenly I was free
But you left me without anything

And you trip on a hit of acid
You gotta work for the man
But your biggest moneymaker's flaccid

You gotta keep your shit together
With your feet on the ground
There ain't no one gonna listen
If you haven't made a sound
You're an acid junkie, college flunky
Dirty puppy, daddy bastard

I just want something
I just want something I can never have

You always were the one to show me how

I never used to snore in my sleep 'til this rap shit started
Warm thoughts fill the hot-headed and cold-hearted
Your whole paycheck, you burp it and then fart it
And y'all think I'm gon' stop? Blow it out your ass!
In one year, I got rich, now life's movin' so fast
But bein' broke with no food is just a thing of the past
Plus I'm the new phenomenon like white women with ass
And y'all prayin' that I flop? Blow it out your ass!

In New York, I buy clothing, in Cali, I get green
In Atlanta, I get sleep, in Texas, I sip lean
All these rappers wanna know what I'm gettin' for 16's
Try 80, want a discount? Blow it out your ass!
See in just six months, I infiltrated the system
If you find somebody better, then I'm sorry I missed him
Niggas hate givin' me props 'cause I might use it against them
C'mon, get Ludacris out, blow it out your ass!

If you mad I'm on top then wish me gone
If you mad I'm on the road then wish me home
And if you mad that I'm right, punk, wish me wrong
But after your three wishes, blow it out your ass!

If you mad I'm on top then wish me gone

Sittin' right there in the middle by me

Pulled off the road and kicked it in four-wheel

Like back then maybe I was his husband and maybe he was my wife

And even, the things I don't like about him are fine with me
Because it's not hard for me to understand him because he's so much like me

And I know that it's God's gift to breathe the air he breathes

Money got power and respect
Baby, I just hope times on my side

I've been tryin' all my life
Every block some ones dyin'
Always high here's our life
Come inside

Energies my ammunition
Like AK shells
So think about that when you plan on dissin'
Go straight to hell

Bred to be ballin' since a baby kickin'
I had the smell
Brand new money ladies sniffin'
They take a L

I take a shit on rappers horse worth
Can't die, must conquer the world first
Like a monster to media
On my beautiful girls search

High and low I am no thing u tamper with
Made the plan you should cancel it
Make examples I trample shit

Drop you here, I am cancerous
Answer this, who can handle this?
Scandalous, I dismantle these ants
And piss on a trucer

What your girl don't know won't hurt her
Anything to make this love go further

You're the one (you're the one for me)
When in need (you can call on me)
When in love (is all I want us to be)

'Cause I feel that I'm the type of girl
You should give a chance
Taste and see (taste and see)
How good it can be (how good it can be)

Move like you want it, groove like you need it

Free your mind 'cause tonight we are gonna break it down
Shake it, make it, funky down
Get so high as the toxins in your body
Are the bass and drums and the ra ra ra

We are right on time
And all is fine
If you've lost your senses
Here have mine and

Lose yourself
From the time you awake
'Til the evening time
Until the sunshine breaks, and come on

Static-X,No Submission,0,angry,"Shut out, cut out, bloodless
Hopeless, hating as I fade
Pulsate, pushing, head exploding
Razor sharp the tongue is

Put down, run out, I could care less
Throw down as I hate
Feeding, needing, severed bleeding
Pull it our exposing

Take a beating, needle speeding
Fall into a daze
Defecation, detonation
Tear the tongue apart and

Terminate it, suffocate it
Spitting in your face
Accelerate, exterminate it
Take it all in hand

With the breath of life I now live abundantly
All I needed was the potter's hand
And the blood on Calvary (that's right)

But to much power (tell it)
Can can sometimes turn to shame
To much desire
Sometimes makes you feel the same (come on)
But forgiveness is how you win the game
I begged for truth, now I know the truth
And that is when you came and said I was

Beautiful, loved and blessed
I'm better than the day before
Cause you made me confess that I am
Beautiful, loved and blessed
When you're free you're really free indeed
All you gotta do is just plant the seed

A constant battle to stay ahead of the game
Is anybody famous when everybody wants fame?
Always trying to break you down
Thinkin' that'll raise 'em up
I just wanna be happy
Come take this bitter cup from me

To take all their money to wade back again.

Goodbye to my Juan, farewell Roselita,
Adios mis amigos, Jesus y Maria.
You won't have a name when you ride the big airplane.

Eric Clapton,River of Tears,3,sad,"It's three miles to the river
That would carry me away
And two miles to the dusty street
That I saw you on today

It's four miles to my lonely room
Where I will hide my face
And about a half a mile to the downtown bar
That I ran from in disgrace

Lord, how long have I gotta keep on running?
Seven hours, seven days or seven years
All I know is, since you've been gone
Feel like I'm drowning in a river

That Surrounded the way
How loud the sea's roar on the four

Ancient long ago
Together they closed in the circles we know
Will we treasure all the secrets with life's changing scenes

Where our hearts were warm with love

So much love
Will the flowers grow again as I open

Terry works in a rock and roll band
Lookin' for that million dollar sound

But some nights I don't go
Some nights I go to the drive-in
Or some nights I stay home

I followed that dream
Just like those guys do up on the screen
And I drove a Challenger down Route 9
Through the dead ends and all the bad scenes
And when the promise was broken
I cashed in a few of my dreams

Then there's a joy of a beautiful lady
And the joy of the morning dew

Tossing and turning, emotions were strong

You nearly gave me a heart attack"" yeah well
He's underneath my window, now she's singing
'Hey-la my boyfriend's back'
You shouldn't come around here
Singing up to people like that
Oh, anyway, whatcha gonna do about it?

O Juliet, the dice were loaded from the start
And I bet... and you exploded into my heart
And I forget, I forget, the movie song
When are you gonna realize
It was just that the time was wrong
Juliet

Well we both come up on different streets
And they were both streets of shame
You know, they're both dirty, both mean
And yes even our dreams were the same

What prize do memories bring?
It ain't every day you get to hear living legend sing""

Where am I? (Where am I?)
Where the hell am I?
Yo, it's ill

Yo, my wife's tired of fucking me
Life tries ducking me, luckily I find 'em just at the right time
Mack in my right arm, Tequila bottle in my left arm like Cristian
Watching my life go, can't do myself in

Wolves in the night, yo, hell's men
Two revolvers, I can let twelve spin
Hop in my Benz, push it to the limit, buck-sixty, who wit' me?
My Cris', two L's, twisted blunts and inner conscience

Telling me that I ain't shit, no matter how much cash I sit with
Still gotta ask the Lord for forgiveness
My precious baby girl came like forty nights of rain
To replenish my adolescent brain

Blessed be her name, before her birth I was insane
So I drive to cool the pressure down, delay the pain
I ate from these poisonous, fucked up streets
Tasted larceny, it was sweet, I starve for more to eat

Though I took, that was to live, hope God will forgive
As odd as it is, the more I gain the harder it is
To maintain, bitches playin' games, niggas snitchin', I ain't sayin' names
But y'all niggas better watch how y'all slang

Lost so many close niggas; drunk, almost crashed
I'm going too fast, highway patroller just flash
Lights in my rearview, if they stop me I hope they lock me
Instead they speed ahead, yo, nigga watch me

Won't you show me that you understand
But it's only my life, whatever that means
But you've got it all in your hands

Well, I need someone to pull me through
Won't you take the pain from my head
Give me all your loving, the way you always do
Baby, give me breakfast in bed

And my nights are getting too long
My hopes and my fears take their toll on the years
And my will power's almost gone

He's more than the laughter or the stars in the heavens
As close as a heartbeat or a song on her lips
Someday she'll trust Him and learn how to see Him
Someday He'll call her and she will come running
And fall in His arms and the tears will fall down and she'll pray

I want to fall in love with You
I want to fall in love with You

And your eyes go dead
And the shadows start to crawl
In the back of your head

Inside

You've got me feeling emotions
Deeper than I've ever dreamed of

The one you shouldn't hurt at all

It's because I love you most of all

Diana Ross,One More Chance,3,sad,"Feel like a fool
Not realizing all the value you had
I took a happy ending and made it sad
The day I walked away and left you alone
with hardly an explanation
You stood on your own
And handled the situation
And showed to me
How understanding you could be

Now I'm alone
Looking back at all the years that we shared
Thinking of the pain you should have been spared
Afraid to ask forgiveness
But where can I go
There's no one else to turn to
I still have my pride
But now its time to learn to cast it aside
And come to you with honesty

Then I stole away
Kissed her farewell
And wished her the best for life
Then I stole away, woah
Like a thief in the night

Ever since you found yourself in someone else's arms
I've been tryin' my best to get along
But that's ok there's nothing left to say, but

Take your records, take your freedom
Take your memories, I don't need 'em
Take your space and take your reasons
But you'll think of me
Take your cap and leave my sweater
We have nothing left to weather
In fact, I'll feel a whole lot better
You'll think of me, you'll think of me

I went out driving, trying to clear my head
I tried to sweep out all the ruins that my emotions left
I guess I'm feeling just a little tired of this
And all the baggage that seems to still exist

Never had no kissin', oh, what I've been missin'
Lover man, oh, where can you be?

The night is cold and I'm so all alone
I'd give my soul just to call you my own
Got a moon above me but no one to love me
And lover man, oh, where can you be?

Don't have a friend who feels at ease

The ones you left, our friends deserted
See the guys that used to talk and drink with you

I gave her time

I gave her passion

I gave her promises
And secrets so untold

And she promised me forever
And a day we'd live as one
We made our vows
We'd live a life anew
And she promised me in secret
That she'd love me for all time
It's a promise so untrue
Tell me what will i do?

And it doesn't seem to matter
And it doesn't seem right
'cause the will has brought
No fortune
Still i cry alone at night
Don't you judge of my composure
'cause i'm lying to myself
And the reason why she left me
Did she find in someone else?

(who is it?)
It is a friend of mine
(who is it?)
Is it my brother!
(who is it?)
Somebody hurt my soul, now
(who is it?)
I can't take this stuff no more

I am the damned
I am the dead
I am the agony inside
The dying head
This is injustice
Woe unto thee
I pray this punishment
Would have mercy on me

And she promised me forever

Suspended clear in the sky
Are the words that we sing in our dreams

They catch a cab to his high rise apartment
At last he can tell her exactly what his heart meant

Could've been you

Guess I should have been cool
Maybe I was too kind

You're nothing but a history, a second here and then you're gone

So help her if you can
'Cos she don't seem to have the attention span

A young world crashing around me
No possibilities of getting what I need
He looked at me and smiled
Said ""No, no, no, no, no child.

See the dog and butterfly. Up in the
Air he like to fly."" Dog and butterfly
Below she had to try. She roll back down
To the warm soft ground laughing
She don't know why, she don't know why
Dog and butterfly

Well I stumbled upon your secret place
Safe in the trees you had tears on your face
Wrestling with your desires frozen strangers
Stealing your fires. The message hit my mind

Roll down your windows and ride
They'll be sleepin' in the sand dunes dancin' in the streets

The boys try to give them a ride
To the one last party 'fore the school bell rings
They're just tryin' to keep the summer alive

They're just tryin' to keep the summer alive
(sum sum summer)
They're just tryin' to keep the summer alive

Joanna Newsom,En Gallop,2,relaxed,"This place is damp and ghostly
I am already gone
And the halls were lined with the disembodied...
...And dustly wings, which fell from flesh
Gasp-less-ly

And I go where the trees are
And I walk from a higher education
For now, and for hire

It beats me but I do not know
It beats me but I do not know
It beats me but I do not know
I do not know

Whole lot of hearts shaking tonight
From the disease of conceit
Steps into your room

How many, many times the worm had turned

When they said that man could fly

They told marconi
Wireless was a phony
Its the same old cry

Where the people are grand and time is planned

Under cigarette trees, we? ll take our ease
While the cops fan off the flies

There you will be a lucky sinner
With no conscience for your guide
Each horse you pick will be a winner
And the doors of every bank are open wide

Now let me welcome everybody to the Wild Wild West
A state that's untouchable like Eliot Ness

Pack a vest for your Jimmy in the city of sex
We in that sunshine state where the bomb-ass hemp be
The state where you never find a dance floor empty
And pimps be on a mission for them greens
Lean mean money-making-machines servin' fiends

I been in the game for ten years makin' rap tunes
Ever since honeys was wearin' Sassoon
Now it's '95 and they clock me and watch me
Diamonds shinin', lookin' like I robbed Liberace
It's all good, from Diego to the Bay
Your city is the bomb if your city makin' pay
Throw up a finger if you feel the same way

Freaky dicky star speckles and pink butterflies
