And the people from the good part of town
All come around but the something is missing
Even though theres more there now
I shrug off my attempts to explain
How a torn Tshirt made it all danger again

I dont like talking about the old days
Except if it tells where the future will lead
So we take a walk down this haunted hall
Or stumble through a shattered recall
I know theres nothing to relive

The bridge
Engulfed by fog

The rest of
The metal bridge
It beckons
It pulls me in
I argue
I scream at God
For what hes offering

My hands fly off the steering wheel
Cant recall getting here
If I could I would reach behind
And turn my light on
My thoughts run off the beaten track
Theres no light
Hows the way back
Take the hand of God
And bite the fear
No more lingering

Hell theres plenty of light still left in your eyes

Breathing smoke through his microphone
The airwaves stretch and they groan
Bleeding birthing his black diapason

He says Theres plenty of things to wear when you come to me
Every color of sleeve to be rolled
Millions of rolling eyes that still cling to me

Of paying you back for all the faith you ever had in your brain

Through an old book in rainy weather
You see a picture of her smiling at you
When you were still together
You could be walking down the street
And who should you chance to meet
But that same old smile youve been thinking of all day

Why dont we turn the clock to zero honey

To let you know tonights the night
For me and you my parttime lover

We are undercover passion on the run
Chasing love up against the sun
We are strangers by day lovers by night
Knowing its so wrong but feeling so right

If Im with friends and we should meet
Just pass me by dont even speak
Know the words discreet with parttime lover
But if theres some emergency
Have a male friend to ask for me
So then she wont peek its for you my parttime lover

Was that this woman she glowed so

Id rather have hard times together

Dashing and daring a drink he was sharing
With wicked Felina the girl that I loved
So in anger

I challenged his right for the love of this maiden

Lions in the street and roaming
Dogs in heat rabid foaming
A beast caged in the heart of a city
The body of his mother
Rotting in the summer ground
He fled the town

He went down South and crossed the border
Left the chaos and disorder
Back there over his shoulder

One morning he awoke in a green hotel
With a strange creature groaning beside him
Sweat oozed from its shiny skin

Is everybody in
The ceremony is about to begin

WAKE UP

Wake up
You cant remember where it was
Had this dream stopped

The snake was pale gold
Glazed  shrunken
We were afraid to touch it
The sheets were hot dead prisons

And she was beside me
Old she is not young
Her dark red hair
Her white soft skin

Now run to the mirror in the bathroom
Look
She is coming in here
I cant live thru each slow century of her moving
I let my cheek slide down
The cool smooth tile
Feel the good cold stinging blood
The smooth hissing snakes of rain

I liked to crawl back into my brain

And well erect a different steeple

Swarming towards the true insects
Feasting on buried dreams
And spreading decay upon your skin

Casts light upon your secrets
Forced to confront your enemies

His mouth is a vortex
Sucking you into its pandemonium
Fools you with a helping hand of ashes
Reached out in false dismay
His body is a country

Did you fail when you found that you
Paid the price
Hope it wasnt lost in an honest truce

Been through
Every little thing that you did was right
But who knows what you did on the day you cried endlessly
Ooh you cried endlessly

Descending deeper
With black as my light
With twist and turn

The call to save us all
Lest we fall to our knees
The death we kiss his feet

In blindness do we run

If only I could hunt the hunter

And all I really want is some patience
A way to calm the angry voice

Peeping out every block close
Seeing which one will clock the most

Now clearing them out meant casualties
Still had the LA mentality
Bust a cap and outta there in a hurry

Shall behead the drought
Wound under sleeves

In a thicket of vines

Stretched ribs and let taste
Well cover the smell with silver nitrate

Soft as a downy chick
It was made from the feathers of fortyeleven geese

Itd hold eight kids and four hound dogs
And a piggy we stole from the shed
We didnt get much sleep but we had a lot of fun

There was fog crawling over the sand

Oh we were lying together in a silver lining

The Kinks,Waterloo Sunset,2,relaxed,"Dirty old river
Must you keep rolling
Flowing into the night
People so busy
Make me feel dizzy
Taxi light shines so bright

But I dont need no friends
As long as I gaze on Waterloo sunset
I am in paradise

Shalala Every day I look at the world from my window
Shalala But chilly chilly is evening time
Waterloo sunsets fine Waterloo sunsets fine

John Lennon,You Are Here,2,relaxed,"From Liverpool to Tokyo
Its a way to go
From distant lands one woman one man
Let the four winds blow

Over the ocean
Three thousand light years
From the land of the risin sun

Love has opened up my eyes

John Denver,Take Me Home Country Roads,2,relaxed,"Almost heaven West Virginia
Blue ridge mountains Shenandoah river
Life is old there older than the trees
Younger than the mountains growin like a breeze

Country roads take me home
To the place I belong
West Virginia mountain momma
Take me home country roads

All my memories gather round her
Miners lady stranger to blue water

John Denver,Farewell Andromeda (Welcome to My Morning),2,relaxed,"Welcome to my morning
Welcome to my day
Yes Im the one responsible
I made it just this way

To make myself some pictures
See what they might bring

I wouldnt change a thing

Welcome to my happiness
You know it makes me smile
And it pleases me to have you here

Elton John,Dixie Lily,2,relaxed,"Showboat coming up the river
See her lanterns flicker in the gentle breeze
I can hear the crickets singing in the evening
Old Dixie Lily moving past the cypress trees

My little boat she rocks easy
Ive been catching catfish in the creek all day
Oh and Ive never seen ladies like those on the big boats
Must be fancy breeding lets you live that way
