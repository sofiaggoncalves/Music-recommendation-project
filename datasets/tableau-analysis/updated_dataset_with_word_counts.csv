Gets started its over
Now the days are much shorter
And the people from the good part of town
All come around but the something is missing
Even though theres more there now
I shrug off my attempts to explain
How a torn Tshirt made it all danger again

I dont like talking about the old days
Except if it tells where the future will lead
So we take a walk down this haunted hall
Or stumble through a shattered recall
I know theres nothing to relive

Put his hands to the sky

If she refuses to be mine

In his bed I am queen unobtainable me
Sexual being human with feelings
The two are not me
The two will not be mine
And what can you do with a girl
If she refuses to be mine

Put his hand on my shirt Hand on my shirt
Hand on my face Hand on my face
Head to the wall Head to the wall
When youve broken your only doll

And what will you do with a girl
If she refuses to be alive

Marty Robbins,El Paso,2,relaxed,"Out in the West Texas town of El Paso
I fell in love with a Mexican girl
Nighttime would find me in Rosas cantina
Music would play and Felina would whirl

Blacker than night were the eyes of Felina
Wicked and evil while casting a spell
My love was deep for this Mexican maiden
I was in love but in vain I could tell

One night a wild young cowboy came in
Wild as the West Texas wind
Dashing and daring a drink he was sharing
With wicked Felina the girl that I loved
So in anger

I challenged his right for the love of this maiden
Down went his hand for the gun that he wore
My challenge was answered in less than a heartbeat
The handsome young stranger lay dead on the floor

Just for a moment I stood there in silence
Shocked by the foul evil deed I had done

Id been staring out the window most of the morning
Id watched the rain claw at the glass
And a vicious wind blew hard and fast
I should have taken it as a warning

As a warning
A warning
As a warning

Id given my nurse the weekend off
My meals were ill prepared
My typewriter had turned mute as a tomb
And my piano crouched in the corner of my room
With all its teeth bared

All its teeth bared
All its teeth bared
All its teeth bared

I left my house without my coat
Something my nurse would not have allowed
And I took the small roads out of town
And I passed a cow and the cow was brown
And my pajamas clung to me like a shroud

Like a shroud

The concrete world is starting to get ya
The city is alive the city is expanding
Living in the city can be demanding
Youve pawned everything everything you own
Your toothbrush jar and a camera phone
You dont know where youre going
You cross the street
You dont know why you did
You walk back across the street
Standing in the sitting room totally skint
And your favorite jersey is covered in lint
You want to sit down but you sold your chair
So you just stand there
You just stand there
You just stand there

Glorified and embraced by your victory
When youre done you escape with that memory
Blindfolded through this life as we learn
And consequences when the wrong page is turned

Its an E True Hollywood Story
Take a man down with his own glory
Now guess whos next

At some point we come down from the highs
And so be it we move on with our lives
Cause some of us let the laughs cover cries
Do the math you can laugh when I die

If life is just a fantasy then could you
Live this fantasy life If so then would you

I thank you Lord for my birth and everything thats followed

I made a promise and Im loving my wife to the end
I thank you Lord for your guidance cause its all that counts
And right here right now Lord this is your house
I thank you Lord for a dream that came true to light
And I ask you to bless everybody in this room tonight
I dont always do the right thing and I ask you to forgive me
Cause I need you here with me without You in my life its empty
I think back how some people did me like violence was the remedy
And because I think of that now I pray for my enemy
Not because of what Ill do but because they dont know
Theres something better after here but everybody wont go
So I ask you to forgive them and well hope they see
And I thank you for the love that theyve given to me
I will not abuse it nor will I lead them astray
You see I love them like children that I see everyday
And I pray no we pray together
Get us through the bad weather and well love you forever
Let your thought and my heart go hand in hand
I first thought but to start but I stand a man
And for as long as I can as long as you permit me
Please give me the strength I need to live bear with me

Not only sent you away but made you stay away from me

Follow your word and be true

Her dark red hair
Her white soft skin

The smooth hissing snakes of rain

And regain control of my mainframe
My bloods boiling its beatin out propane
My train of thoughts more like a runaway train
Im in a fast car drivin in a fast lane
In the rain and I might just hydroplane

I dont fear none of my enemies
And I dont fear bullets from Uzis
Ive been dealing with something thats worse than these

The sane and the insane rivalry

Take away my anxiety

No fortune
Still i cry alone at night

Would have mercy on me

Tell you now that the whole town is empty

But I was raised on the other
In the wee hours of youth my mother took sick
And I was brought up by my brother

The iron ore poured as the years passed the door
The drag lines in the shovels they was humming
Til one day my brother failed to come home
The same as my father before him

Como uma força que ninguém pode parar
Como uma força como uma força
Como uma fome que ninguém pode matar

It is the wind beneath your feet that makes you fly
It is the beautiful game that you choose to play
When you step out into the world to start your day
You show your face and take it in and scream and pray

Merle Haggard,Leonard,3,sad,"When LEONARD finally came to California
He was twentyone years old as I recall
He loved to write a song and pick the guitar
And he came to hang a Gold one on the wall

The town in which he lived is not important
But youll know which town I mean by the time Im thru
He soon became a famous entertainer
But LEONARD was a name he never used

He was on his way to having what he wanted
Just about as close as one could be
Hey once he even followed Elvis Presley
And he wrote a lot of country songs for me

Steven Curtis Chapman,His Eyes,2,relaxed,"Sometimes His eyes were gentle and filled with laughter
And sometimes they cried
Sometimes there was a fire of Holy anger
In Jesus eyes

But the eyes that saw hope in the hopeless
That saw through the fault to the need
Are the same eyes that look down from heaven
Into the deepest part of you and me

And His eyes are always upon us
His eyes never close in sleep
And no matter where you go
You will always be in His eyes
In His eyes

Steven Curtis Chapman,Lord of the Dance,1,happy,"On the bank of the Tennessee River
In a small Kentucky town
I drew my first breath one cold November morning
And before my feet even touched the ground
With the doctors and the nurses gathered round
I started to dance I started to dance

A little boy full of wideeyed wonder
Footloose and fancy free
But it would happen as it does for every dancer
That Id stumble on a truth I couldnt see
And find a longing deep inside of me it said

I am the heart I need the heartbeat
I am the eyes I need the sight
I realize that I am just a body
I need the life
